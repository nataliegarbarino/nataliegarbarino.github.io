		<h1>Baskerville vs. Adobe Caslon</h1>
		<h2>History of each typeface</h2>

		<h3>Caslon</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
		<p>William Caslon introduced the Caslon typeface in 1722, drawing inspiration from 17th-century Dutch old style
			designs which had gained popularity in England. Caslon’s original old style typefaces were intended to be
			versatile and legible for body text, ideally ranging from 6 to 14 points. They quickly became widely used in
			magazines, journals, books, and corporate communications due to their exceptional functionality. Benjamin
			Franklin favored Caslon’s typefaces almost exclusively and the Declaration of Independence was printed in
			Caslon. Carol Twombly adapted the Caslon design for Adobe in 1990, studying specimen pages printed by
			William Caslon from 1734 to 1770. The OpenType Pro version, released through Adobe, consolidated previously
			separate fonts, added support for Central European languages, and included extra ligatures. This adaptation
			expanded the typeface’s usability, making it more versatile and accessible for modern design.</p>

		<h3>Baskerville</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->
		<p>Baskerville was created by John Baskerville in 1757 in Birmingham, England, during the Age of Enlightenment
			and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Inspired by Caslon, Baskerville aimed to refine and improve its
			legibility, experimenting with readability, paper, and ink manufacturing processes to achieve higher-quality
			printing. The typeface was cut into metal plates for printing presses, reflecting Europe’s shift from
			ornate, asymmetrical designs to Neoclassical aesthetics. Baskerville served as a transitional typeface,
			bridging the gap between old-style typefaces like Caslon and modern typefaces such as Didot and Bodoni. In
			2016, Baskerville Display PT font was released by ParaType to be used by Adobe. Its designers are Arina
			Alaferdova and Dmitry Kirsanov.</p>


		<h2>Comparison</h2>
		<h3>Similarities</h3>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/h.jpg" alt="One orange Caslon capital H and one green capital H in Baskerville.">
			<figcaption>Both Hs have a similar size and style of serif, with Caslon's (left) being slightly more
				irregular and Baskerville’s (right) more refined and structured. Both letters have a similar high
				contrast between thick and thin strokes, which is evident in the thin stroke of the horizontal bar.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/o.jpg" alt="One orange Caslon lowercase o and one green lowercase o in Baskerville.">
			<figcaption>Both share a similar oval shape, with Baskerville (right) having a slightly more geometric and
				balanced form than that of Caslon (left). Both display high contrast in stroke thickness, emphasizing an
				elegant, refined appearance.<figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/e.jpg" alt="One orange Caslon lowercase e and one green lowercase e in Baskerville.">
			<figcaption>Both lowercase e's have a similar round, serif-free shape. The contrast in each of them is
				rather subtle.<figcaption>
		</figure>


		<figure>
			<img src="images/7.jpg"
				alt="Two Orange and green number seven glyphs overlayed to show similarity of shape.">
			<figcaption>Both Caslon and Baskerville have sevens with rounded bases and serifs on their horizontals.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>


		<figure>
			<img src="images/exclamation.jpg"
				alt="Two Orange and green exclamation points overlayed to show similarity of shape.">
			<figcaption>Both Caslon and Baskerville have tapered exclamation points, forms which match the contrast of their other glyphs.

		<h3>Differences</h3>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/baseline_comparison.jpg"
				alt="The word handgloves is set in caslon and baskerville with horizontal lines at the x-height, ascenders, and descenders.">
			<figcaption>Caslon (left) and Baskerville (right) both have cap lines equivalent to their ascender lines.
				However, Caslon has a greater x-height and cap/ascender height. Caslon alos has lower ascenders. This
				means that at the same point size, Caslon is an overall larger font.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/quotes.jpg" alt="Two opening quotating marks.">
			<figcaption>Caslon (left) has far less contrast in its double quotation marks. Additionally, the space
				between the individual quote swashes is much greater in Baskerville's (right).
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/question.jpg"
				alt="Two distinct question marks including one in Caslon and one in Baskerville.">
			<figcaption>Caslon’s question mark is significantly less rounded at the top than Baskerville's is.
				Baskerville's question mark has dramatic contrast, while Caslon's is more subtle.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/g.jpg"
				alt="Two Orange and green lowercase letter g's one in Caslon and one in Baskerville.">
			<figcaption>Caslon’s ear (left) the small stroke at the top right of the "g" is more pronounced and slightly
				curved. Baskerville’s ear (right) is more delicate and refined, adding to its neoclassical style. The
				tail (the
				connection between the upper and lower portions) in Caslon is more organic and slightly irregular.
				Baskerville’s tail is smoother and more controlled.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/a.jpg"
				alt="Two Orange and green lowercase letter a's one in Caslon and one in Baskerville.">
			<figcaption>Caslon’s ear (left) the small stroke at the top right of the "g" is more pronounced and slightly
				curved. Baskerville’s ear (right) is more delicate and refined, adding to its neoclassical style. The
				tail (the
				connection between the upper and lower portions) in Caslon is more organic and slightly irregular.
				Baskerville’s tail is smoother and more controlled.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/s.jpg"
				alt="Two Orange and green lowercase letter a's one in Caslon and one in Baskerville.">
			<figcaption>Caslon’s ear (left) the small stroke at the top right of the "g" is more pronounced and slightly
				curved. Baskerville’s ear (right) is more delicate and refined, adding to its neoclassical style. The
				tail (the
				connection between the upper and lower portions) in Caslon is more organic and slightly irregular.
				Baskerville’s tail is smoother and more controlled.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/italics.jpg"
				alt="Two uppercase italic A's.">
			<figcaption>Baskerville Italic has more of an upright appearance, while Caslon Italic is more angled helping
				it to achieve a more organic and calligraphic look. The Caslon capital A is also easily distiguishable
				from Baskerville's because it has a curve at the apex, even in its italic form.

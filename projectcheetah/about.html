                        <h2>Aerodynamic fairing</h2>
                        <h4>The Cheetah's fairing is a low drag aerodynamic shape. It was
                            designed
                            by fitting airfoil sections around interference measurements of the rider and
                            vehicle.</h4>
                        <h3>Custom airfoils</h3>
                        <p>Four separate airfoil sections are utilized in the design, each of
                            which
                            was custom created to optimize for low drag based on length, velocity, wobble,
                            and
                            air conditions anticipated at the record location. Other sections in the fairing
                            are
                            interpolations of these four optimized layers.</p>
                        <p>Michael Selig, Associate Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University
                            of
                            Illinois at Urbana Champagne, who at the time was an aerodynamics grad student
                            at
                            Penn State, optimized the airfoil sections based on the required sizes
                            determined by
                            the Cheetah Team. Using custom software written for the Macintosh by James
                            Osborn,
                            the sections were fit around the interference data. Changes in the desired
                            section
                            sizes were given back to Selig for further optimization. The result of this
                            iterative process is a very smooth low drag shape.</p>

                        <h3>Building the fairing</h3>
                        <p>The fairing was constructed out of carbon fiber epoxy composite material utilizing a
                            multi-step process. Once optimized, each airfoil section was cut precisely from Styrofoam
                            slabs. A male master plug was created by stacking up these slabs, gluing, sanding, coating,
                            painting and buffing. Then fiberglass female molds were created from this master. And
                            finally, extremely thin and light finished fairings (one for training and one for record
                            attempts) were fabricated using these molds.</p>

                        <h2>Powering the Cheetah</h2>
                        <p>The drivetrain of the cheetah is that of a conventional bicycle since it is a very efficient
                            way of transferring power, however an intermediate gear assembly was custom designed and
                            built to step up the gear ratio between the front chain ring and the rear freewheel cluster.
                            This arrangement allows the cyclist to pedal at an rpm which enables him to deliver maximum
                            power at speed near the targeted record. The intermediate assembly accepts standard bicycle
                            chainrings, and rotates upon a pair of lightweight aircraft bearings, about a fixed shaft
                            mounted to the frame. At the front end of the frame, a large hollow aluminum insert includes
                            features for mounting the steering tube for the front forks, the bottom bracket (pedal
                            spindle), and the front fairing mount. Similarly, at the rear of the frame inserts provide
                            dropouts (rear wheel mounting locations) and rear fairing mount locations.</p>

                        <h2>The internal frame</h2>
                        <p>The Cheetah's frame is a hollow monocoque design which is composed of carbon fiber epoxy
                            composite material which is widely used in the Aerospace Industry due to its characteristics
                            of high specific stiffness and strength. It has a large box cross-section which makes it
                            very stiff and strong in a global sense despite the fact that locally, the composite is very
                            thin. One can easily compress the frame's sides inwards 1/4 inch with hand pressure.</p>
                        <h3>No stress</h3>
                        <p>In order to exploit the global strength and stiffness, high localized stresses at the drive
                            train, seat, steering axis and wheels are carefully engineered to distribute the loading
                            gently into the large thinwall box section. The intermediate gear set at the frames center
                            is mounted to an extremely stiff honeycomb panel concealed within its mid-section. Specially
                            designed attachment points for the seat help transfer all of the power of the vehicle’s
                            rider to the pedals. Loading at the wheels and steering is distributed via aluminum inserts
                            which are tapered and bonded into the thin walled structure with high strength aerospace
                            adhesive.</p>

                                <p class="white">The U.C. Berkeley Human Powered Vehicle Team named their creation
                                    Concept Z as a symbolic moniker, implying that it would be the final perfect
                                    iteration in the design process. Though, it became clear that it could be more
                                    perfect. Drawing from their college coursework, the Cheetah team targeted several
                                    deficiencies which would spell the difference between a successful design and one
                                    capable of setting a world record.</p>

                                The Concept Z was designed using a published NACA airfoil profile which was stretched
                                and expanded to fit the rider and frame. NACA shapes are designed for use on airplanes.
                                For the Cheetah custom airfoils were optimized for the lowest drag at the record speed.
                                A significant reduction in the drag coefficient was realized in this process.</p>

                                The Concept Z suffered from losses due to poor wheel alignment. A precision jig made to
                                align wheel components during the composite frame construction was a critical
                                improvement.</p>

                                Every assembly on the Concept Z was analyzed for its strength to weight ratio and was
                                optimized on the Cheetah. In the case of the seat, a heavy bicycle seat, composite back
                                support and metal mounting assembly was replaced by a one-piece carbon fiber structure
                                which was custom formed to fit the cyclist.</p>

                                The Concept Z suffered power transmission loss due to frame deflection at a drivetrain
                                attachment point. On the Cheetah this area of the frame was locally stiffened to
                                eliminate power lost through deformation.</p>

                        <h2>Cheetah secrets</h2>
                        <p>The semirecumbent riding position of the cheetah was determined by rotating the position of
                            the racing cyclist by 90 degrees, thereby allowing for maximum power to be produced by
                            placing the driver in an efficient conventional racing posture. The rotation worked to
                            minimize vehicle frontal area, a variable directly proportional to Aerodynamic drag.</p>
                        <p>The cheetah seat was formed by creating a casting of the rider's rear end combined with the
                            rotated bicycle saddle. This casting was transformed into a plug and eventually a perfectly
                            fitting light hollow seat. This produced a virtually seamless integration point joining
                            rider to drive system.</p>
                        <p>Any openings in an aerodynamic fairing may exact a significant drag penalty. The Cheetah
                            avoided this by sealing the front wheel opening with a flexible membrane attached to a frame
                            that was attached to the front wheel. This arrangement allowed steering with a minimal
                            opening.</p>
                        <p>With vibrations induced by wheel mis-alignment, road roughness, fairing attachment resonances
                            and airflow induced vibration it can be challenging to maintain control and trajectory at
                            speeds in excess of 60 mph. Hidden under the frame and carefully coupled to the front
                            steering tube is a dampener to smooth out any disturbance which threatens perfect control.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, during the final series of attempts the team came across an abandoned tabby kitten,
                            a new pet that they dubbed Cheetah. He was, they felt, a Talisman which brought the last bit
                            of magic enabling this historical achievement.</p>

                            <p>The Cheetah's frame is a hollow monocoque design which is
                                constructed
                                with carbon fiber epoxy composite material. It has a large box section which
                                makes
                                the frame very stiff in a global sense despite the fact that locally, the
                                composite
                                is very thin. You can easily compress the frame's sides inwards 1/4 inch with
                                hand

                                In order to mount components to the Cheetah, honeycomb stiffening panels were
                                built
                                into the frame where needed. Additionally, at the front and rear ends of the
                                frame,
                                where the aluminum inserts were later bonded in, the composite was layered
                                thicker
                                to distribute the shock loading smoothly into the composite. The inserts
                                themselves
                                were also tapered to a thin edge to reduce the discontinuity in stress at the
                                edge
                                of the insert bonding surface.</p>

                            <h3>Custom airfoils</h3>
                            <p>Four separate airfoil sections are utilized in the design, each of
                                which
                                was custom created to optimize for low drag based on length, velocity, wobble,
                                and
                                air conditions anticipated at the record location. Other sections in the fairing
                                are
                                interpolations of these four optimized layers.</p>

                            <p>Michael Selig, Associate Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University
                                of
                                Illinois at Urbana Champagne, who at the time was an aerodynamics grad student
                                at
                                Penn State, optimized the airfoil sections based on the required sizes
                                determined by
                                the Cheetah Team. Using custom software written for the Macintosh by James
                                Osborn,
                                the sections were fit around the interference data. Changes in the desired
                                section
                                sizes were given back to Selig for further optimization. The result of this
                                iterative process is a very smooth low drag shape.</p>

                            <h3>Constructing molds</h3>
                            <p>The fairing was constructed out of carbon fiber epoxy composite material
                                utilizing a
                                multi-step process. First sections were cut precisely from Styrofoam slabs. A
                                male
                                master plug was created by stacking up these layers, gluing, smoothing, painting
                                and
                                buffing. Female molds were created from this master. And finally, the finished
                                fairings (one for training and one for record attempts) were fabricated using
                                these
                                molds.</p>

                                step up the gear ratio between the front chain ring and the rear freewheel cluster.
                                The intermediate assembly accepts standard bicycle chainrings, but actually spins
                                upon a pair of lightweight aircraft bearings, about a fixed shaft mounted to the frame.

                            <h3>Optimizing speed</h3>
                            <p>The front chain loop is fixed and does not shift, hence the Cheetah only has seven
                                speeds. With the intermediate gear assembly though, it is equivalent to using a
                                chainring with over 100 teeth on a conventional road bicycle! In fact the
                                Cheetah's lowest speed is about the same as a road bike's top speed. This makes for
                                tricky
                                starts since the rider is pedaling very slowly at first. This does not present a
                                problem for a professional cyclist and with the Cheetah's low drag, the rider is
                                able to "get on top of" that first gear in short order.</p>

                            <p>Bicycle components donated by Campagnolo include a
                                tensioned Kevlar rear disk wheel and a generous selection of alloy chainrings and
                                freewheels. Most other components were custom designed and fabricated by the Cheetah
                                Team.</p>
                            <p>The aerodynamic fairing which encloses the rider of the Cheetah is also
                                constructed of carbon fiber composite. Aerodynamic design and advice was provided by
                                Michael Selig (currently an assistant professor of aeronautical engineering at the
                                University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne). The Cheetah weighs in at 29.5
                                pounds complete with fairing and ready to ride.</p>

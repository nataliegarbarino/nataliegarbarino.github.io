                            <h2>Engineering the World's Fastest Bike</h2>

                            <p>The Dexter Hysol Cheetah is a fully faired semi-recumbent two wheeled Human
                                Powered Vehicle (HPV). The Cheetah currently holds the world speed record for the 200
                                meter flying start event. This event allows a virtually unlimited run up to a 200 meter
                                speed trap. Chris (The Punisher) Huber rode the Cheetah to an an average speed of 68.73
                                mph through the speed trap. The record was set at about 6:55 PM mountain standard time
                                on September 22, 1992. The course was on Six Mile Lane which is a flat road which
                                crosses a Bison preserve in the San Luis valley, Colorado. Of course, the Cheetah is
                                named after the fast cat of the same name.</p>
                            <p>The Cheetah is predominantly constructed of carbon fiber composites with aluminum inserts
                                bonded in with Hysol adhesives. Bicycle components donated by Campagnolo included a
                                tensioned Kevlar rear disk wheel and a generous selection of alloy chainrings and
                                freewheels. Most other components were custom designed and fabricated by the Cheetah
                                Team. The aerodynamic fairing which encloses the rider of the Cheetah is also
                                constructed of carbon fiber composite. Aerodynamic design and advice was provided by
                                Michael Selig (currently an assitant professor of aeronautical engineering at the
                                University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne). The shape of the Cheetah was designed by
                                the Cheetah Team using a custom written Macintosh program. The Cheetah weighs in at 29.5
                                pounds complete with fairing and ready to ride.</p>
                            <p>The International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA) participated in and
                                sanctioned the event. Two IHPVA officials witnessed the event and the timing equipment
                                was provided by the IHPVA. For more information about IHPVA, see their website
                                (http://www.ihpva.org). The format and rules for the 200 meter flying start event were
                                originally proposed by DuPont with a $25,000 price to be awarded to the first HPV to
                                exceed 65 mph. This was accomplished and the prize awarded to the Gold Rush, ridden by
                                Freddie Markham, in 1986 with an average speed of 65.48 mph. The current record of 68.73
                                mph set by The Cheetah team September 22, 1992 still stands.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">The Cheetah's fairing is a low drag aerodynamic shape. It was
                                    designed
                                    by fitting airfoil sections around interference measurements of the rider and
                                    vehicle. Four separate airfoil sections are utilized in the design, each of
                                    which
                                    was custom created to optimize for low drag based on length, velocity, wobble,
                                    and
                                    air conditions anticipated at the record location. Other sections in the fairing
                                    are
                                    interpolations of these four optimized layers.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    Michael Selig, Associate Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University
                                    of
                                    Illinois at Urbana Champagne, who at the time was an aerodynamics grad student
                                    at
                                    Penn State, optimized the airfoil sections based on the required sizes
                                    determined by
                                    the Cheetah Team. Using custom software written for the Macintosh by James
                                    Osborn,
                                    the sections were fit around the interference data. Changes in the desired
                                    section
                                    sizes were given back to Selig for further optimization. The result of this
                                    iterative process is a very smooth low drag shape.</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    The fairing was constructed out of carbon fiber epoxy composite material
                                    utilizing a
                                    multi-step process. First sections were cut precisely from Styrofoam slabs. A
                                    male
                                    master plug was created by stacking up these layers, gluing, smoothing, painting
                                    and
                                    buffing. Female molds were created from this master. And finally, the finished
                                    fairings (one for training and one for record attempts) were fabricated using
                                    these
                                    molds.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">The Cheetah's frame is a hollow monocoque design which is
                                    constructed
                                    with carbon fiber epoxy composite material. It has a large box section which
                                    makes
                                    the frame very stiff in a global sense despite the fact that locally, the
                                    composite
                                    is very thin. You can easily compress the frame's sides inwards 1/4 inch with
                                    hand
                                    pressure.</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    In order to mount components to the Cheetah, honeycomb stiffening panels were
                                    built
                                    into the frame where needed. Additionally, at the front and rear ends of the
                                    frame,
                                    where the aluminum inserts were later bonded in, the composite was layered
                                    thicker
                                    to distribute the shock loading smoothly into the composite. The inserts
                                    themselves
                                    were also tapered to a thin edge to reduce the discontinuity in stress at the
                                    edge
                                    of the insert bonding surface.</p>

                                <h3 class="space-above">How Cheetah Runs</h3>
                                <p class="mb-4">At the front end of the frame, a large hollow aluminum insert is
                                    bonded
                                    into the frame. This insert includes features for mounting the steering tube for
                                    the
                                    front forks, the bottom bracket (pedal spindle), and the front fairing mount.
                                    The
                                    insert was designed to be rigid and yet evenly disperse into the frame composite
                                    itself the shock loading induced by pedaling and riding the Cheetah.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">Similarly, at the rear of the frame, aluminum inserts are bonded
                                    into
                                    the frame to provide dropouts (rear wheel mounting locations) and rear fairing
                                    mount
                                    locations.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">An intermediate gearing assembly was custom designed and built to
                                    step
                                    up the gear ratio between the front chain ring and the rear freewheel cluster.
                                    The
                                    intermediate assembly accepts standard bicycle chainrings, but actually spins
                                    upon a
                                    pair of lightweight aircraft bearings, about a fixed shaft mounted to the frame.
                                    The
                                    front chain loop is fixed and does not shift, hence the Cheetah only has seven
                                    speeds. With the intermediate gear assembly though, it is equivalent to using a
                                    chainring with over 100 teeth on a conventional road bicycle! In fact the
                                    Cheetah's
                                    lowest speed is about the same as a road bike's top speed. This makes for tricky
                                    starts since the rider is pedaling very slowly at first. This does not present a
                                    problem for a professional cyclist and with the Cheetah's low drag, the rider is
                                    able to "get on top of" that first gear in short order.</p>

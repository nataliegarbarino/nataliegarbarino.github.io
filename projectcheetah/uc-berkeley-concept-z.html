						<h2>UC Berkeley Human Powered Vehicle team</h2>

						<p>In 1986, James Osborn, Jon Garbarino, and Kevin Frantz joined the UC Berkeley Human Powered
							Vehicle Team. The team, a group of 10-15 undergraduate Engineers, had been participating
							annually in a collegiate competition sponsored by ASME (American Society of Mechanical
							Engineers). The objective for these young engineers was to design and construct a vehicle
							within the academic year and enter it into competition with other Universities somewhere on
							the west coast.</p>
						<p>Typically, there were three phases of the competition. In the first phase, the engineers were
							required to write and submit an engineering report detailing their design, analysis and
							testing which supported their final product. Once at the competition, they had to deliver an
							oral report on their design. The second phase had the vehicle tested to determine its
							maximum speed relative to the competition over a designated sprint course. The final phase
							involved side by side racing over a closed road circuit. The overall champion was determined
							by combining a team’s standing over these phases.</p>

						<h2>The engineering process</h2>

						<p>While the goals of the competition were clearly defined at the beginning of each year, the
							path to completing them was not. During this process, there were many challenges to be
							overcome, aside from agreeing on a design concept they needed to secure funds for
							constructing the vehicle, locations to test their design and find a place to build it. All
							of these demands needed to be met while studying and progressing through their coursework.
						</p>


						<h3>Demands of the project</h3>

						<p>The first major hurdle was finding a place to work on a campus where available workspace was
							at a premium. The answer was a very small unused room sitting on the roof of Etcheverry
							Hall. The room itself was small, but the rest of the roof provided an expansive and scenic
							outdoor work area.</p>

						<p>Team members found sponsors from local industry and networked with local aerospace companies
							to obtain construction materials, use of facilities, and additional technical expertise.</p>
						<p>They relied on learning from their Statics, Dynamics, Aerodynamics, Mechanics of Materials,
							Composite Materials Analysis Courses and Computer Science to complete the design. They
							learned how to machine from the Etcheverry Hall Mechanicians and were able to fabricate the
							unique metal components their design required.</p>

						<h2>1988: Concept&nbsp;Z's first ASME competition</h2>

						<p>In 1988, Concept&nbsp;Z, Berkeley’s first semi-recumbent 2 wheeled HPV, was entered into the
							ASME
							annual competition at Sacramento State University. Their design was both innovative and
							overly ambitious, undergoing key steps of assembly the night before the competition.</p>
						<p>The weekend’s events provided the initial ground for testing and significant design
							errors quickly became apparent. Despite its shortcomings, the vehicle provided a
							tantalizing glimpse into its potential in the final road race as it chased down and
							caught the competition's fastest designs. It was a harbinger to the other
							Universities that Berkeley would soon make its mark in human powered technology.</p>

							<h2>1989: An improved Concept&nbsp;Z</h2>
							<p>In 1989, a new look and further optimized Concept&nbsp;Z traveled to Cal State
								Northridge.
								It was clear from the start that Cal would be in contention as they finished first
								in the design portion of the competition. Going into the final road racing event,
								the team led the overall competition. However, several on-track mishaps resulted in
								a 2nd place finish.</p>

							<h3>What they won</h3>
							<p>They sacrificed their free time away from classes and worked exhaustively into the
								weekends and nights for a second place trophy? Team members agree that being
								involved with the HPV Team afforded opportunities that their classwork provided in
								limited ways. Being on the team allowed them to autonomously explore creative
								applications of their education, test their understanding of what they were learning
								and, most importantly, collaborate with other like minded students to accomplish a
								common goal.</p>

								<h2>Segway to a record</h2>

								<h3>A Tour Sparks an Idea</h3>
								<p>In the Spring of 1989, with Graduation on the horizon, several members of the team
									were
									invited to tour Dexter Hysol, an aerospace adhesives company who had provided
									products
									used
									in Concept&nbsp;Z. Upon seeing the facility and products, a few team members emerged
									with an
									idea.</p>
								<p>Spurred by the feeling that the potential of their design had not been realized, the
									team
									wrote a letter to Dexter proposing that they fully subsidize the design and
									construction
									of
									a vehicle for the purpose of breaking the world land speed record. The selling
									concept
									was
									that the vehicle, which incorporated many of Dexter Hysol’s products, would be an
									eye-catching advertising symbol — a symbol that could tie their products to an
									exciting
									and
									historic achievement. Over the summer, several members of the team again traveled to
									Dexter
									and, this time, delivered a proposal which secured facilities, materials, and
									compensation.
									The Cheetah project was born!</p>
